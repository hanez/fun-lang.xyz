## What is Fun?

Fun is a highly strict programming language, but also highly simple. It looks like Python (My favorite language), but there are differences.

Influenced by **[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/){:class="ext"}**, **[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language){:class="ext"}**, Go, **[Lua](https://www.lua.org/){:class="ext"}**, **[Python](https://www.python.org/){:class="ext"}**, and Rust (Most influences came from linked languages).

Fun is and will ever be 100% free under the terms of the [Apache-2.0 License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0){:class="ext"}.

## Idea

 - Simplicity
 - Consistency
 - Joy in coding
 - Fun!

### Extras

 - PC/SC smart card support builtin (optional)

## Characteristics

 - Dynamic and optionally statically typed
 - Type safety
 - Written in C (C99) and Fun
 - Internal libs are written with no_camel_case even when written in Fun, except class names
 - Only a minimal function set is written in C, and most other core functions and libraries are implemented in Fun

## The Fun Manifesto

Fun is a programming language built on a simple idea:
Coding should be enjoyable, elegant, and consistent.

### Philosophy

 - **Fun is Fun**<br>
   Programming should spark creativity, not frustration. Code in Fun feels light, playful, and rewarding.
 - **Fun Uses Nothing**<br>
   Minimalism is power. No unnecessary features, no endless syntax variations, no formatting debates. Just clean, uniform code.
 - **Indentation is Truth**<br>
   Two spaces, always. No tabs, no four-space wars. Code should look the same everywhere, from your laptop to /usr/bin/fun.
 - **One Way to Do It**<br>
   No clutter, no 15 ways of writing the same thing. Simplicity means clarity.
 - **Hackable by Nature**<br>
   Fun should be small and embeddable, like Lua. Easy to understand, extend, and tinker with — true to the hacker spirit.
 - **Beautiful Defaults**<br>
   A language that doesn’t need linters, formatters, or style guides. Beauty is built in.

## The Community

Fun is not about being the fastest or the most feature-rich. It’s about sharing joy in coding. The community should be:

 - Respectful
 - Curious
 - Creative

Like the name says: Fun Unites Nerds.

Please visit the [Fun Community Page](https://fun-lang.xyz/community/) to get in touch.

## The Goal

A language that feels like home for developers who:

 - Love minimal, elegant tools
 - Believe consistency is freedom
 - Want to write code that looks good and feels good

Fun may not change the world — but it will make programming a little more fun.

## Documentation

I am writing documentation only actually, but this is work in progress, since debugging and bug fixing includes this task.

Current documentation is only found in the [Fun Handbook](https://git.xw3.org/fun/fun/src/branch/main/docs/handbook.md){:class="git"}.

In the [examples/](https://git.xw3.org/fun/fun/src/branch/main/examples){:class="git"} directory should be an example of most Fun features.

A complete API documentation will follow.
